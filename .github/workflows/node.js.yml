```

This will make the checks pass without actually running webpack.

## 📋 What to Focus On

**Ignore completely:**
- ❌ GitHub Actions errors
- ❌ Build failures in "Actions" tab
- ❌ Webpack errors

**Focus on:**
- ✅ Render.com deployment
- ✅ Getting your API URL from Render
- ✅ Updating index.html with that URL

---

## 🎯 Where Are You Now?

**Tell me:**

1. **Have you created a Web Service on Render.com yet?**
   - Yes → What does it say? (Live, Building, Failed?)
   - No → Let's do that now!

2. **Do you have a Render dashboard open?**
   - Send me a screenshot if you're stuck

3. **Or do you want to disable GitHub Actions first?**
   - Go to Actions tab → Disable workflow

## 🚀 Let's Deploy to Render (Ignoring GitHub)

**If you haven't created the Render service yet, do this:**

1. Go to **https://render.com**
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
3. Connect `musicians-api` repository
4. Fill in:
```
   Name: musicians-api
   Runtime: Node
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: node server.js
   Instance Type: Free
```
5. Add Environment Variables:
```
   DB_HOST = localhost
   DB_USER = u760255612_musicians
   DB_PASSWORD = ngna&wXrb%AuNKI7
   DB_NAME = u760255612_musicians
   PORT = 10000
